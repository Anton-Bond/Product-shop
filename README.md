First clone project.

You have two ways, by git:

$ git clone https://github.com/sq3hll/svod-demo.git path-to-project

Or download compressed package by pushing button “Download ZIP”.

Next go to the project path, and install node module dependencies:

$ npm install

Run project (server and client parts):

$ npm run dev

Server is on http://localhost:3000
Client is on http://localhost:4200

If need only server side, just start in project folder:

$ npm run server
